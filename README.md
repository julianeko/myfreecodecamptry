# Juliane's Freecodecamp.org pages

Copyright 2021 Juliane Kohnert

These are just test pages for me to learn html/css. I do the freecodecamp.org course and the pages are part of the course. 
So, regarding to the content I did not give it too much of a thought as the challenge here is the coding. 
But the easier it will be for me to code, the more thoughts I will give to the content.
